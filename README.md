# AI Integrations API

A **.NET 9 Web API** proof-of-concept that integrates with multiple LLM providers.  
Currently, **Claude (Anthropic)** is implemented; **OpenAI** is stubbed out for future support.  

The project demonstrates:
- Provider abstraction (`IChatProvider`, `ChatProviderFactory`) for swapping AI backends
- **Swagger UI** with example requests/responses
- **API key authentication** (owner/guest keys with expiration, GUIDs)
- **Serilog logging** (file sink locally, console/App Insights in Azure)
- Support for **conversational context** (message history) with Claude

---

## Current Implementation

- ‚úÖ **Claude support** ‚Äî working multi-turn conversations (context retained if you include previous messages in the request)  
- üöß **OpenAI provider** ‚Äî stubbed with `"Not implemented yet"` response  
- üîë **API Key auth** ‚Äî set via `UserSecrets` locally or App Service configuration in Azure  
- üìù **SessionId and Provider fields** ‚Äî included for planned frontend integration. Right now, they can be ignored or set manually.  
- üîÑ **Messages array** ‚Äî in the future, this will be automatically tracked by the backend.  
  For now, you must **manually append previous turns** in Swagger to simulate multi-turn conversations.
